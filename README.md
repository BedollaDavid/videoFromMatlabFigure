# videoFromMatlabFigure
The .m file generates a video from animating a figure
### **What is this?**
It is a script that animates a figure on Matlab, moreover you can save the animated figure as a video with arbitrary length time.
### **What do you need?**
•Any figure or set of figures using plot or plot3.\
•Any number of subplots for each figure.\
•Any number of pair data (x, y, z) or (x, y).\
•Any length of pair data.
### **What will you obtain?**
•An animation of the data without changing any figure property.\
•A video will be obtained if the option “generate video” is enabled.
### **How to use it?**
**Step 1:** Plot the desired figures (one animation per figure).\
**Step 2:** Set the animation total time (in seconds).\
**Step 3:** Verify if you want to save the animation as video (true or false).\
**Step 4:** Run the script and let it to finish (write the name of the video when asked).\
